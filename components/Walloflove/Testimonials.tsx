    quote: `Transitioned from a web developer to a video editor, always wanted to try it but didn't know the math. My friend suggested me this, I was a bit skeptical after taking all those Udemy courses it will be the same but no, both Martin and Ocus are really experienced in video editing, they made learning really fun and easy. It surely took some practice after the session but their guidance truly helped. I'm glad that I took my friends advice.`,

The network I've gained access to, which includes India's top editors, content creators, and freelancers, has been invaluable. My life took a turn for the better when I was offered an internship at Aevy, made possible through the mentorship of great leaders like Varun Mayya, Kuntur Sir papa ocus, and Martin. Their guidance continues to shape my present and future. This investment has been life-changing and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to take their career to the next level.`,

    quote: `This cohort was the YouTube industry break-in for me, it not only turned me into a professional editor but also taught me how content industry actually works. Before this cohort I struggled with editing as the tutorials on YouTube were unstructured and the Return On Investment I got from this cohort is at least 100x. Now I am not only good at editing, but also got to know how to curate a good video, hook the audience better, mimic editing style of top YouTubers. Now I understand the power of visual storytelling which was taught by best-in-industry mentors like Ocus, Martin, Varun, Kuntoor.`,
